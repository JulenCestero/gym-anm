REFACTORING

SIMULATOR
- un-comment check_casefile() and fix its bugs
- use bounds on |S| for branches, in MVA
- compute branch P, Q, I from both sides
- remove rng seed from Simulator -> should not model any stochastic processes

RENDERING
- deal with title during Replay
- check that replay still works

DOCUMENTING
- check if "array_like" can be used (or what to use when list or array)
- check if functions return  list or arrays -> make consistent
- document __init__ files
- add module docstrings
- how to reuse parent's attributes in docstring

SCENARIO HARD
- increase PV production a little bit
- increase industry consumption !!
