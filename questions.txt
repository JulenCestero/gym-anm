Questions to ask:

3. should time series always be initialized on January, 1st?


To do:
- reset time series generation in env.reset().
- clean code generating stochastic processes




1. Create env
2. Start Dash app, implemented as a class storing the env object
3. Start action loop
4. Every x seconds, refresh Dash app by calling a method of self.env (ex: env
.get_obs)

-> shouldn't need any external file
